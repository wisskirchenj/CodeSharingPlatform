over the internet. The Code Sharing Platform will as well provide a web interface delivering text/html as
an API interface providing application/json content-type. Code snippets shared will also be stored in
a database.

Purpose of doing this project, is getting more familiar with CSS / html frontends and practising Spring boot
applications - also using new functional Spring 5 WebFlux routing techniques.
