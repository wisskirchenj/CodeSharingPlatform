# IDEA EDU Course ...

Implemented in the Java <b>Backend Developer</b> Track of hyperskill.org's JetBrain Academy.<br>
https://hyperskill.org/projects/130

Project goal is to implement a Spring boot application with functional endpoints. The application
will serve as a platform for code sharing between developers over the web.
The Code Sharing Platform will simultaneously provide a web interface delivering text/html and
an API interface providing application/json content-type. Code snippets shared will also be stored in
a database.

Purpose of doing this project, is getting more familiar with CSS / html frontends and practising Spring boot
applications - also using new functional Spring 5 routing and handling techniques.

As build tool gradle is used this time to get to know this tool better.
